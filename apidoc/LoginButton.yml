summary: A Facebook login button.
description: |
    The Login Button created by <Modules.Facebook.createLoginButton>.  This is a 
    Facebook-themed button that does not require a click event handler or any listeners.  
    Click events on the button are automatically handled by the Facebook module.

    The button changes its label to reflect the current state of the Facebook 
    session.  For example, if the user is already logged in, this button will show "Logout".

    See the examples in the <Modules.Facebook> documentation.
